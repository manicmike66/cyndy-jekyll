  <h2 class="my-3">Lesson One: cleaning the head</h2>
  <p>Step 1. Remove the sewing machine head from the treadle cabinet or box.<br>
    Machines fitted into auto drop cabinets are fixed in place with a lever or a long bolt at the front, and by the 1890s almost all have hinge pins at the back which are usually (but not always in the case of auto drop and coffin lid cabinets) fixed to the machine bed by small grub screws; with the head swung back on the hinges loose these screws and the head should easily slide off the pins, but be aware that it can weigh up to 20kg. </p>

<div class="col-8">
Remove bobbin case and or shuttle, presser foot, needle, slide plates and needle plate, and put them all in a container so nothing, especially screws, gets lost. For extended storage while restoring it is a good idea to put these items into separate zip-lock bags with description of where they belong.

With an old tooth brush clean away any and all loose lint, dust and grime from around feed dogs and the under-bed area.

Step 4. 
</div>
<div class="col-8">
With a damp soft clean rag, clean the head of dirt and grime.  Try not to get any solvents on the transfer decals as this will damage them, to help protect the decals from the next step give the head a light polish with a beeswax based spray furniture polish.

Step 5.
</div>
<div class="col-8">
 Scrub the moving underparts of the machine with an old toothbrush dipped in kerosene and using a syringe or dropper, drop some kero in all the oil holes; don't worry too much if you get kero on the decals, I have been assured by several old sewing machine guys that they have soaked seized up heads in kero for several days and the decals were not affected Turn the balance (hand) wheel over to work the kerosene into all the working parts, if your machine does not turn over, rock it gently till it does-be patient as this can take time if the machine has been seized for many years.  Keep doing this till the machine moves easily and quietly, then oil as per the instructions in the manual.

Step 6.

<div class="col-8">
Polish all the chromed metal parts you previously took off the machine with ultra fine (0000) grade steel wool (good hardware stores should stock this) and a good quality metal polish, I like Autosol Metal Polish.
