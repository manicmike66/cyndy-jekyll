  <p><font size="+2">Philip H. Diehl invented a vertical oscillating shuttle for 
    Singer in the late 1870s, and this was the basis of the Singer 15 class with 
    the introduction of the 15-1 (AKA Improved Family) in 1879 as well as a number 
    of industrial models&#151;specifically the 17 and 18 class for shoe making 
    as well as some early 15 and 16 subclasses for specific garment industry applications. 
    This type of shuttle is called an oscillating shuttle in early catalogues 
    and generally referred to as a &quot;long beak&quot; by collectors so as to 
    avoid confusion with the horizontal oscillating hook used in the 66 and 99 
    class.</font></p>
  <p><font size="+2">Of all the Singer models, there is probably far more variety 
    in the 15 class than any other; I have counted close to 100 different submodels, 
    most were designed for quite specific industrial  applications and even include 
    chain stitch models. In this article I will concentrate on the main domestic 
    incarnations you are most likely to encounter: </font></p>

        <h3>15-1 introduced in 1879</h3>
        <p>Notable for its distinctive fiddle or serpentine bed and long beak 
          shuttle, this model had a very primitive tension with a screw in stud 
          and no tension release. The 15-1 was slowly superseded by a number of 
          intermediate models in the 1890s with the familiar 370mm × 178mm bed 
          and a 1 o&#146;clock bobbin case. There is evidence that Singer stole 
          the design for this fingered bobbin case vertical oscillating shuttle 
          from Dürkopp but the records are rather murky on the matter. Regardless 
          of who designed it, this case would come to be generically known as 
          a &quot;15 class&quot; in the 20<sup>th</sup> century.<br>

          continuing to be used in industrial machines used in the shoe making 
          industry.</p>
        <p><a href="../pricelist/p05.htm">Feet are low shank</a>, and while technically 
          any low shank domestic foot suitable for straight stitching will fit, 
          there are feeding issues with hinged feet because of the feed dog design. 
          This means that many modern feet, including clip shank, are not suitable 
          so I recommend keeping an eye out for vintage feet.</p>
        <p>New throat and slide plates are not really available, but a new HA-1 
          slide can be cut to size.</p>

          quite as good as the original parts. However, the HA-1 tension nut and 
          tension plates will work if the originals are lost and I find the #32575 
          check spring intended for the 66 class is a better match than any 15 
          class spring supplied to me. </p>
        <p><b>Balance Wheel etc.</b>: as the end shaft of the machine is considerably 
          longer than the later &quot;standard&quot; set by Singer, only original

          over time become most closely associated with the Singer 15 class. To 
          my best research the first Singer to feature this bobbin case was the 
          15-11.</font></p>
        <p><font size="+2">There is evidence that Singer stole the design for

          it, this case would come to be generically known as a &quot;15 class&quot; 
          in the 20th century, but I urge you to not fall into the trap of calling 
          non-Singer central bobbin (CB) machines &quot;clones&quot; as (except 
          for the bobbin, bobbin case and shuttle hook) there is some variation 
          among these machines. </font></p>
        <p><font size="+2">Singer made a brief return to the long beak shuttle 
          with the 15-22 (according to a Singer part catalogue the 15K1 had a 
          rectangular bed like the 15-22 so positive ID will rely on knowing where 
          the machine was made) and continued to use it in industrial shoe vamping 
          machines (17 and 18 class) and these models are still in production 
          in Asia and this is why shuttles and bobbins are still available. </font></p>
        <p><font size="+2">I have not been able to find much information about 
          the early 1 o'clock bobbin case 15 class machines of the 1890s, possibly 
          because of the patent dispute with D&uuml;rkopp.</font></p>

              15K26 and 15-30 went into production in Kilbowie and Elizabethport

            <p align="center"><img src="pic/singer/15K26.C.01.jpg" width="500" height="400"></p>
            <p align="left">My knowledge of the 15-30 is mostly indirect, but 
              I have two examples of 15K class manufactured in 1908.</p>
            <p align="left">It is not really my habit to &quot;name&quot; my machines, 
              but due to a situation that had me scratching my head for a very 
              long time (and I have as yet to discover an absolute truth for) 
              I have named the following three 15K models:<br>
              <b>&quot;Vali&quot; Ser. No. V74094 allotted Jan-June 1908<br>
              &quot;Vera&quot; Ser. No. V802470 allotted July-DEC 1908<br>
              &quot;Frida&quot; Ser. No. F7835922 allotted July-DEC 1917</b><br>
            </p>
            <p align="left"> &quot;Vera&quot; is a confirmed 15K26 (although). 
              &quot;Vali&quot; though superficially the same is a bit of a mystery 
              as she has a different tension and underworkings. Even though I 
              have found no mention of a 15K11 in the official record, I suspect 
              that &quot;Vali&quot; may be an example as the design of the rocking 
              shaft matches that of the 15-11 I found in a Singer parts catalogue.</p>

              <img src="pic/singer/15K26F.tbd.jpg" width="500" height="400"> </h2>
            <p>Initially the 15K26 was manufactured with a pillar mounted winder 
              and a heavy balance wheel with a 35mm shaft, just like the earlier 
              version of the 15K. This heavier wheel means that the only suitable 
              hand crank for these early model 15 class must be era specific.</p>
            <p>In the 1910s (evidence suggests the start of WW1) the 15K26 design 
              was modified to be more ecconomical to manufacture. The pillar mounted 
              winder was replace with one mounted winder wheel guard (similar 
              to the 66K1) and a lighter weight 25mm shaft balance wheel. Both 
              Vera and Frida (early and later version 15K26) have a tension with 
              a screw in stud and an internal pin to release the tension. All 
              three models have the standard 370mm × 178mm bed and a 1 o&#146;clock 
              bobbin case. </p>
            <p>All 15-30 class models have a wheel guard mounted &quot;worm&quot; 
              winder like &quot;Frida&quot;. While an early version of the submodel 
              (as described in a parts catalogue) has a tension release similar 
              to Vali, by 1915 the tension on Elizabethport 15-30 machines appears 
              to be the same or similar to Vera and Frida. I can't comment on 
              the balance wheels as I have only seen photos and sometimes machines 
              are misidentified.</p>
            <p>While the latter version of the 15K26 was mostly out of production 
              by the start of the 1930s, replaced by the cheaper to manufacture 
              15K80 and the more advanced 15K88, I have seen at least one example 
              dated to 1945 (possibly as a result of using old parts during rationing).</p>

        <p> Most parts are available with few complications. New balance wheels 
          and hand cranks are compatible.</p>

          last blast 15 model in the early 1960s, the 15K110 was a 1 o'clock BC 
          model which adopted some of the innovations developed by Toyota, Brother 
          and Janome in the early 1950s for their <a href="info-J-HA1.htm">HA-1 
          Class </a>models. </font></p>
        <p><font size="+2">After the Singer factories in the USA and Kilbowie 
          stopped manufacturing any version of the 15 class, it continued to be 
          made in Taiwan and later China for places where a simple mechanical 
          machine which could be treadled or hand-cranked was preferable to an 
          electric machine which could do a variety of stitches. Sadly the quality 
          of the Chinese made machines dropped to match the price NGOs with the 
          best of intentions are willing to pay and so while they are on occasion 
          imported into Australia to be sold as &quot;nostalgia&quot; machines, 
          they are really only suitable as décor.</font></p>
