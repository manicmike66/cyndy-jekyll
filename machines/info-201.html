      <h3>HISTORICAL NOTES ON THE SINGER 201 CLASS</h3>
      <p>The 201 was developed at Singer&#146;s Wittenberge factory in the 1920s 
        as the 201D. The 201&#150;1 treadle went into production at Singer&#146;s 
        main plant at Elizabethport in NJ USA around 1930, however the most popular 
        submodel was the 201&#150;2 with a direct drive potted motor. Almost no 
        belt drive 201&#150;3 or hand crank 201&#150;4 were produced for the North 
        American market. North Americans are usually only familiar with the 201&#150;2 
        so please keep that in mind when researching your machine.</p>
      <p>The body was remodelled in cast in aluminium and designated; 201K21 treadle, 
        201K23 belt drive motor, 201K24 hand crank. The body shape of the aluminium 
        machines are slightly different but this does not affect their function. 
        There is no record of a potted motor aluminium submodel being manufactured, 
        but if it was it would have the designation &#147;22&#148;.</p>

      <p>The original 201 developed and manufactured in the Wittenberge Singer 
        Factory (Prussia, Germany) The &quot;D&quot; stands for Duitsland (German 
        for Germany) as Singer had already designated &quot;W&quot; to the former 
        Wheeler and Wilson factory.<br>
        The 201D is relatively rare outside of Europe, if you find one in Australia 
        it will because it came with a post WW2 migrant. <br>
        Serial No. of all Wittenberge Singer machines begin with a C. Very little 
        is known about Wittenberge machines as the records did not survive WW2.</p>

      <p>Going into production at Singer's Elizabethport factory around 1930. 
        Though many people still believe the model was developed in the USA, since 
        the 201D production predates the first 201&#150;1, that belief is highly 
        problematic.<br>
        However, it is likely that the 201&#150;2 submodel with the potted motor 
        was developed at Elizabethport. While the 201&#150;1 head was the same 
        as the 201&#150;3 and 201&#150;4, the only difference being the solid 
        balance wheel with a large pulley on the 201&#150;3 for the belt drive 
        motor, the direct drive potted motor 201&#150;2 head was used a different 
        casting mould. The Elizabethport 201 was never officially imported to 
        Australia, however some people have imported 201&#150;2 privately.</p>

      <p>The 201 class went into production at the Kilbowie factory (Scotland 
        Great Britain) in 1935.The same year King George V celebrated the Silver 
        Jubilee of his reign, so Singer took the opportunity to advertise the 
        201K as the Jubilee model. The 201K1 (and 201K2, 201K3 and 201K4) was 
        manufactured at Kilbowie till the late '50s. Only small numbers of the 
        201K2 were manufactured. It is unlikely that the direct drive potted motor 
        was ever officially marketed in Australia.<br>
        The potted motor 201K2 was the model used in the film &quot;The Dressmaker&quot;, 
        but as the Classic 201 weighs over 20kg it is highly unsafe to carry by 
        the lid's handle. If you don't want to risk breaking a toe, always carry 
        a vintage machine from under the box.</p>
