      <h2>Advertisements for Pinnock Sewing Machines located at the QV Markets 
        George St Sydney first appeared in Sydney news papers around 1907</h2>
      <p>What is unknown about the early history of this Australian based retailer 
        and importer definitely outweighs what is known but in the 1920s and '30s, 
        they were among a number of significant sewing machine retailers in Australia. 
        Most of the machines they imported and &quot;badged&quot; with their Pinnock 
        branding in the early days appear to have come from a variety of German 
        manufacturers. </p>
