      <h2 align="left">The importance of the VS driver pivot point is often overlooked. 
        When I am trying to ID a badged machine, it is the first thing I look 
        for. I can also tell by the position of the pivot if a Singer # 83505 
        shuttle is likely to be compatible as the swing of the arm defines the 
        shape of the shuttle</h2>
      <p align="center"><img src="pic/VSPP.f01.jpg" width="800" height="480"><br>
        In this diagram you can see clearly the importance of the swing of the 
        carrier and how a longer swing would require the nose of the shuttle to 
        be a different shape. I have highlighted the arc of the swing in green. 
        For a lock stitch to form neatly the needle thread must pass smoothly 
        around the shuttle (highlighted in yellow) with the nose if the shuttle 
        gliding against the wall of the arc. This is why the nose of the shuttle 
        requires lubrication.<br>
        The shuttle carrier is highlighted in turquoise; the position of the carrier 
        can be adjusted by loosening screw &quot;A&quot;.<br>

    <td width="602">Because of the Singer Manufacturing Company&#146;s international 
      market dominance, it did to some extent set the standard for the position 
      of the pivot point. This is not to be confused with &#147;copying&#148; 
      any more than the standardisation of micro USB/charger port is copying. 
      When making a consumer product you need to consider the convenience of the 
      end user, and conforming to the shuttle, needle, presser foot etc used by 
      a similar Singer model will prove to be more convenient to your customers.<br>

        fact that its position can be seen in most photos which show the top face 
        of the bed, does help in deciding whether it is worth trying a # 83505 
        shuttle if the original is lost and is important when trying to identify 
        a machine</h3>
