      <h5 align="center">Identifying other machines</h5>
      <p>This can be harder than you might imagine, many machines sold by retailers 
        were &quot;badged&quot; with the store's branding, in Australia Bebarfald 
        labelled most of their machines &quot;Blue-Bird&quot; even though they 
        were made by a number of manufacturers in Europe and America, as did Marcus 
        Clark with &quot;New Century&quot; and Pinnock under their own name. </p>
      <p>Japanese manufacturers started making sewing machines in the late 1920s, 
        but really came into their own in the 1950s during the post war reconstruction.</p>
      <p>No matter how much Singer may have dominated the market between 1860 
        and 1960, they had plenty of competition from the many other smaller manufacturers 
        around the planet, and though they may not have had the market share the 
        machines they produced were often of superior quality and more innovative 
        in design.</p>
