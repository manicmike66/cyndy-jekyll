  <h5 align="center">Identifying other machines</h5>
  <p>This can be harder than you might imagine, many machines sold by retailers were &quot;badged&quot; with the store's branding, in Australia Bebarfald labelled most of their machines &quot;Blue-Bird&quot; even though they were made by a number of manufacturers in Europe and America, as did Marcus Clark with &quot;New Century&quot; and Pinnock under their own name. </p>
  <p>Japanese manufacturers started making sewing machines in the late 1920s, but really came into their own in the 1950s during the post war reconstruction.</p>
  <p>No matter how much Singer may have dominated the market between 1860 and 1960, they had plenty of competition from the many other smaller manufacturers around the planet, and though they may not have had the market share the machines they produced were often of superior quality and more innovative in design.</p>
