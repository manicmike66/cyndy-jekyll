      <p align="left">Pfaff 30s are tough and reliable domestic sewing machines 
        which mostly date from the mid 1950s and they can often be bought in reasonable 
        condition in treadle cabinets or as portable electric machines (though 
        domestic electric motors more than 50 years old are usually unsafe and 
        should always be safety checked by a small motor specialist). As a central 
        bobbin oscillating shuttle machine, the Pfaff 30 is a family member to 
        the most successful and enduring sewing machine designs ever, so if you 
        are a lucky owner of one of these plucky guys then you really should put 
        it to work, and to that end I may be of assistance.</p>

      <p>I am pleased to be able to offer faithful reproductions of the original 
        instruction booklet supplied with Pfaff 30 and 30/31 Central Bobbin sewing 
        machines. As the machines could be treadle powered or motorised the manual 
        includes lessons on how to work the treadle as well as general care of 
        the treadle. As with many translated technical booklets the grammar is 
        amusing at times, but the illustrations more than make up for those shortcomings.</p>
      <p>While specifically intended for the Pfaff 30 and 30/31 machines, it can 
        also be used as a generic manual for central bobbin straight stitch machines 
        with the tension placed at the front (send me a message if you are uncertain).</p>
