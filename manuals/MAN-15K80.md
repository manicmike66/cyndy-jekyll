<h3>Manual covers the following <a href="../machines/info-15">Singer 15 class</a> submodels<br> 15K80 Treadle<br> 15K81 Hand Crank<br> 15K82 Belt Drive Motor (motor operation not specifically covered)<br> </h3>
<p>Other than an easier to manufacture tension and a simpler bobbin winder the 15K80 is not substantially different to the later variant of the 15K26.  The original manual doesn't distringuish between the three submodels covered in this manual, the only difference being the way they are powered.</p> <h6 align="center">Read about other models in the <a href="{{ "machines/info-15" | relative_url }}">Singer 15</a> class on <a href="{{ "machines/info-15" | relative_url }}">this page</a> </h6>

<p>The manual is carefully scanned, digitally repaired and reconstructed version of a Singer 15K80 manual from the early 1940s with no alteration or editing to the original text except to the title page, and adding a preface showing a treadle and hand crank on the next page, and information about needles on page 14.</p> <p>I have not included the second half of the manual which covers the attachments as I am still digitally cleaning these pages to my exacting standard</p>
