<p>This is an edited and fully revised version of an original instruction booklet supplied with a White Rotary Model 41. The original booklet was intended for an electric powered version of the machine, but as I needed to use it with a treadle machine I revised it for that purpose. I have also updated obsolete terms and made the publication much easier to read and added the following contents page for easy reference:</p>
<ol>
<li> Working the Treadle</li>
<li>Setting the Needle</li>
<li>Choosing correct Needle and Thread</li>
<li>Removing and threading Bobbin Case</li>
<li>To Wind the Bobbin</li>
<li>Threading the Needle</li>
<li>Commence Work</li>
<li>Remove the Work</li>
<li>Stitch Length</li>
<li>Regulating the Tensions</li>
<li>Cleaning and Oiling</li>
<li>Attachments</li>
</ol>
