<p align="left">This Singer Instruction Manual was recreated from a carefully scanned, digitally repaired and reconstructed images and text from an original instructional booklet first printed in 1908 and supplied with a Singer 15K26 of that era (with &quot;V&quot; prefix to serial No.) but is a suitable manual for most early <a href="{{ "machines/info-15" | relative_url }}">Singer 15 class</a> models as well as many other early era central bobbin oscillating hook machines (please <a href="{{ "a.main/contact" | relative_url }}" >contact</a> me if you are unsure).</p>

<p align="left">The instructional text is the same as for the original documents and does reference charmingly obsolete terms and materials but is also very clear and easy to follow.</p>

<h4>This 28 page reproduction booklet (32 pages including cover) is A5 size (the original was 135mm&times;208mm)</h4> <h4>I also have a short (16 page) version excluding the attachments</h4>
<p>NOTE:<br> Singer do have PDF manuals for 15 class models which can be downloaded from their site for free, but the resolution is low to reduce the file size and Singer have modernised the font, text and layout of their PDF manuals thus losing some of the antiquarian charm of the original instruction book. I am happy to direct you to the location of the free PDF if you are not able to find it on your own. </p>
