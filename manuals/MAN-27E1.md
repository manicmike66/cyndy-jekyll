<p>This Singer Instruction Manual was compiled from carefully scanned, digitally repaired and reconstructed images and text from a pair of original booklets first printed in 1896 and supplied with a Singer 27-2 of that era but is a suitable manual for most Singer 27 and 28 sub-models as well as many other early era vibrating shuttle (long bobbin) machines (please <a href="{{ "a.main/contact.html" | relative_url }}">contact me</a> if you are unsure). </p> <p>The instructional text is the same as for the original documents and does reference charmingly obsolete terms and materials but is also very clear and easy to follow. I added the contents page for ease of use.</p>
