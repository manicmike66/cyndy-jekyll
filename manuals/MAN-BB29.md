<p>This historic document was originally printed by Bebarfalds in 1929 and supplied with the Blue-Bird &quot;1929&quot; model which looks like this:</p>
<p><img class="img-fluid my-1" src="{{ "machines/pic/beb/blu-b1929.01.jpg" | relative_url }}" width="500" height="400"></p>
<p>Bebarfald &#147;badged&#148; most of the machines they sold as Blue-Birds, the pictured &quot;1929&quot; is really a Pfaff 11, but is may have been partially assembled in Australia.</p>
<p>While the booklet has been specifically written for Blue-Bird &#147;1929&#148; model machines housed in Bebarfald automatic bureau treadle cabinets, the instructions will be helpful to owners of many other brands of VS (vibrating shuttle) machines, particularly those housed in similar cabinets; if you are unsure about your machine please <a href="{{ "a.main/contact" | relative_url }}">contact me</a>.</p>

<hr/>
<p>Bebarfald were clearly setting themselves up as the place to buy quality domestic sewing machines though evidence suggests they imported all the sewing machines they installed in their beautifully made cabinets even when their advertising suggests otherwise.  <p>Of the 15 points for &quot;1929&quot;, the only real significant one is the ability to stitch in reverse; while this was not unusual by 1929, few (if any) domestic Singer models had a reverse stitch in the 1920s.  The &quot;direct-ray&quot; sewing light is not a feature of any &quot;1929&quot; which I've seen in person, however I have seen photos of one. </p>
