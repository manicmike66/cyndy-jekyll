        <h3>“New Century” was the house brand the Marcus Clark Dept store used 
          for the machines they sold, regardless of make or model, but in the 
          mid 1920s they imported the Free Sewing Machine Company's "Model E" 
          from the USA to sell as their house brand. <br>
          Other Australian retailers sold the same model as a "Rollos Rotoscillo", 
          so this manual is also suitable for that brand.</h3>

      <h2>An excerpt from the store brochure</h2>
      <p>The Mechanism of the &quot;New Century&quot; Sewing Machine being so 
        much more modern in its construction than any of its competitors renders 
        it absolutely the fastest, lightest running, most easily worked, and the 
        most all-round satisfactory Sewing Machine manufactured.<br>
        Some of the Reasons why we claim the &quot;New Century&quot; Sewing Machine 
        is the Best Article of the kind offered to the Public </p>
      <p><br>

    <td colspan="2"> 
      <p><b>1. The Mechanism is absolutely the BEST.</b><br>
        Why is the Mechanism the Best?<br>
        Because it is the only Sewing Machine made that combines a Rotary Movement 
        with the Vibrating Shuttle. Why is a Rotary Movement the Best? Because 
        with a Rotary Movement you have one piece of mechanism, and only one turn 
        to pick up each stitch; with a vibrating movement there are two pieces 
        of machinery, and two movements to pick up each stitch. Therefore, a Rotary 
        Movement is faster and lasts twice as long as a vibrating movement. <br>
        Then why have a Vibrating Shuttle?<br>
        Because with a Vibrating Shuttle no cotton is wasted. It is not necessary 
        to have two long cottons at the back of the needle when working. </p>
      <p><b>2. There is no hook in the construction of a Vibrating Shuttle. </b><br>
        Therefore, it is impossible for the cotton to catch underneath, pulling 
        the work through the needle plate hole. Anyone who has operated a Rotary 
        Machine with a Rotary Shuttle Movement knows how often fine work is ruined 
        by being pulled down into the race. This never occurs with the &quot;New 
        Century&quot; Combined Rotary Vibrator Machine. </p>
      <p><b>3. The &quot;New Century&quot; Rotary Vibrator has a Rotary upper 
        main shaft in the arm</b>, a Rotary lower shaft under the bed, and connecting 
        these two Rotary shafts a main connection that rotates at both ends. </p>
      <p><b>4. The &quot;New Century&quot; Machine has the shortest needle bar 
        made. </b>This enables you to do very heavy work, much heavier than is 
        usually done on a family Sewing Machine 
      <p> <b>5. The &quot;New Century&quot; Machine has the largest arm.</b> Anyone 
        who has ever worked a Sewing Machine knows the advantage of a high arm. 
        It also has double ball hearings in the stand and a steel ball bearing 
        pitman. 
      <p> <b>6. Self releasing disc tension. </b> 
      <p> <b>7. Automatic Lift, head comes up as you raise machine</b>, belt being 
        always in position. 
      <p> We especially desire to draw attention to the fact that with the New 
        Century Sewing Machine operators can do Chifon, Georgette, and all the 
        delicate fabrics so much in vogue, without any puckering of goods. <br>
        On the New Century 6 or 8 thicknesses of Moleskin can be sewn with ease, 
        and operator can negotiate the heaviest of seams without raising foot. 
        <br>
        We know the New Century Machine is the best Sewing Machine manufactured, 
        and we are always pleased to prove by practical demonstration this statement 
        to you. <br>
