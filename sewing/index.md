  <h5>Pattern Cutting and Design</h5>
  <p>I taught myself the art of pattern cutting in my late teens after discovering that there are several very good instruction books on the subject and have been creating patterns for my own clothing designs ever since.</p>
  <h5>Costume Design and Creation</h5>
  <p>I've been working with theatre companies, individual performers to create what they need for over 20 years.</p>
  <h5>Bone Couture</h5>
  <p>There is a small selection of remnant items of the Bone Couture range from the late 1990s available, and I can make to measure most items from that range though original fabrics may not be available. <a href="{{ "bone/" | relative_url }}">See More</a></p>
  <h5>Cyndy Kitt Casual Wear</h5>
  <p>Short runs and one off items in cotton jersey or interesting vintage fabrics.</p>
  <h5>Cyndy Kitt Bags and Hats</h5>
  <p>Strong and practical fully machine washable bags for your weekly grocery shop and funky little hats.</p>
  <h5>Cyndy Kitt Rouleau Jewellery</h5>
  <p>I started making these as I can sew the rouleaus on the treadles on display at Anne Bonny's Locker and hand finish them with my stash of vintage buttons and beads.</p>
  <h5>Other Stuff</h5>
  <p>For the right price I am able to repair or do alterations to anything from formal to leather. I have five industrial sewing machines in my workroom which incluse a four-thread overlocker, heavy duty walk-feed and a blind hemmer as well as a standard straight sewer flat bed.</p>
